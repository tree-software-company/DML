# 🧩 DML — Descriptive Markup Language

DML is a simple, JSON-like descriptive language that supports variables, arithmetic operations, nested structures, lists, and maps. It was created using Kotlin, ANTLR, and the Java Virtual Machine.

Think of it as a strongly-typed, comment-friendly version of JSON — built for configuration, definition, and readability.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Basic types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `list`, `map`
- ✅ Arithmetic operations (e.g. `number age = 20 + 5`)
- ✅ Nested structures (e.g. `event.user.name`)
- ✅ List & Map literals
- ✅ Type checking with error reporting
- ✅ Simple CLI (`dml read file.dml`)
- ✅ Written in Kotlin + ANTLR

## 🚀 Installation

### 🔧 Option 1: Install via Homebrew (Recommended)

> Coming soon: Homebrew Tap to install globally

```bash
brew tap tree-software-company/dml
brew install dml
```
install the newest version:
```bash
brew uninstall dml
brew untap tree-software-company/dml
brew tap tree-software-company/dml
brew install dml
```
Then you can use it globally like:

```bash
dml read test.dml
```
> ℹ️ The Homebrew formula will download the `.jar` from GitHub Releases automatically.

---

### 💻 Option 2: Manual Installation (Local Development)

#### 1. Clone the repo and build the `.jar`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tree-software-company/dml.git
cd dml
gradle build
```
After build, you'll find your CLI JAR at:
```bash
build/libs/DML-all.jar
```
#### 2. Run the CLI
```bash
java -jar build/libs/DML-all.jar read test.dml
```
#### 3. (Optional) Make it global

Create a wrapper script:
```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/dml
```
Paste:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
java -jar /path/to/DML-all.jar "$@"
```
Then make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dml
```
Now you can run:
```bash
dml read file.dml
```
## 📄 Example DML Code
```bash
string title = "Hello";
number age = 30 + 2;
boolean isActive = true;

list numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
map user = { "name": "Szymon", "email": "example@example.com" };

string message = "Welcome, " + user.name;
```
Output:
```bash
Variables: {
  title=Hello,
  age=32,
  isActive=true,
  numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4],
  user={name=Szymon, email=example@example.com},
  message=Welcome, Szymon
}
```
